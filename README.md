# Word Jumble
This program demonstrates a Word Jumble Game in Python using Tkinter GUI.  

## Description
Word Jumble is a game with a set of words where each word is scrambled.  The player of the game is presented with a random scrambled word that the player must correctly reconstruct.  If the word is reconstructed correctly the player earns a point.  This game is also timed and terminates once the timer runs out.


## Prerequisites
- Python (v3.9.0)
- tk (v8.6) or newer

## Installation
```
- Download python 3.9 interpreter and install in the root directory.
- Tkinter (and, since Python 3.1, ttk, the interface to the newer themed widgets) is included in the Python standard library.  It 
  is highly recommend installing Python using the standard binary distributions from python.org. These will automatically install Tcl/Tk, which is needed by Tkinter.  
- Set environment PATH variable to point to location of python.exe. 
- Open a terminal and issue the following command to run the Word Jumble game:

python main.py 

Or

<Full path to python executable> main.py (i.e. C:\python39\python.exe main.py)

```
